### Hi there, welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹

One of the many aspects I have enjoyed about my job is the ability to manage my time by myself. If you asked me what I could do without being paid, it would be something that would leave some mark on the world. Not necessarily major impact but even a small achievement would be great. We can make the world a better place by helping each other. Working as a community, we are bound to achieve more and, therefore, provide more.
